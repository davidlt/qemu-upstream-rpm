Subject: [PATCH] qemu-1.0.1/VERSION

Hello,

The VERSION file in stable release qemu-1.0.1 has what I believe might be a typo: "1.0,1" rather than "1.0.1". This is causing a parsing issue for windres.exe in Win32 which chokes on:
   #define CONFIG_FILEVERSION 1,0,1,0,1,0
   #define CONFIG_PRODUCTVERSION 1,0,1,0,1,0

when it should be seeing this:
   #define CONFIG_FILEVERSION 1,0,1,0
   #define CONFIG_PRODUCTVERSION 1,0,1,0

Patch:
