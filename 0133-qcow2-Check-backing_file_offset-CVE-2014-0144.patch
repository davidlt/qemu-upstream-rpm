Subject: [PATCH] qcow2: Check backing_file_offset (CVE-2014-0144)

Header, header extension and the backing file name must all be stored in
the first cluster. Setting the backing file to a much higher value
allowed header extensions to become much bigger than we want them to be
(unbounded allocation).
